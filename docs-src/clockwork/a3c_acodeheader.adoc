= The ACode Header

The ACode Header is a data structure found at the beginning of an `.a3c` storyfile.
All its members are four bytes in size.

In the course of the Alpha and Beta development stage, new elements were added to the ACode header, leading to three different possible header structures, depending on the compiler version used:

[%autowidth.stretch]
[cols="2*<m,^d,<a"]
|==============================================================================
| structure          | version     | bytes sz | missing members

| ACodeHeader        | >= 3.0beta2 | 200      | _none_
| Pre3_0beta2Header  | < 3.0beta2  | 196      | `prompt` (last)
| Pre3_0alpha5Header | < 3.0alpha5 | 192      |  `ifids` and `prompt` (last two)
|==============================================================================

ALAN interpreters should check the `version` value to determine which compiler version an adventure was created with, and then use the matching header structure for that version.


== Latest Header

The current default header has 50 members, for a total size of 200 bytes.

The `ACodeHeader` structure is defined in arunsrc:acode.h[477].

== Pre 3.0beta2 Header

The ACode Header in adventures compiled with ALAN versions before `3.0beta2` does not contain the last `prompt` member, so it's 4 bytes shorter (i.e. one Aword).

When ARun detects that and adventure was compiled with ALAN `<3.0beta2` and `>=3.0alpha5` it uses the `Pre3_0beta2Header` structure instead of `ACodeHeader`.
The definition of the `Pre3_0beta2Header` structure can be found in arunsrc:acode.h[534].


== Pre 3.0alpha5 Header

In adventures compiled with ALAN versions before `3.0alpha5` the ACode Header doesn't contain the last two members, `ifids` and `prompt`, so it's 8 bytes shorter (i.e. two Awords).

When ARun detects that and adventure was compiled with ALAN `<3.0alpha5` it uses the `Pre3_0alpha5Header` structure instead of `ACodeHeader`.
The definition of the `Pre3_0alpha5Header` structure can be found in arunsrc:acode.h[590].
